Hi, Iâ€™m @danielle-kotter

As a former MSc student in Management with a specialization in Business Analytics, I have been able to improve my skills in programming and data analysis in the context of business development and strategic decision making. Multiple repositories include group/individual projects from a diverse set of courses taken during the MSc such as practical data science, applied statistics and marketing analytics. In the future I aim to continue developing my skills and using these tools to discover actionable insights to improve the guest experience and ultimately business success. Furthermore, I have additionally made available the bookdown I built to have one summary/overview of the several topics including programming cheat sheets.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my projects.
