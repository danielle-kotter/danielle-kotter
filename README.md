Hi, Iâ€™m @danielle-kotter

As a former Msc in Management student with a specialisation in Business Analytics, I have been able to improve my skills in programming and data analysis in the context of business development and strategic decision making. 

Multiple repositories include group/individual projects in a diverse set of courses taken during the MSc such as practical data science, Applied Statistics and Marketing Analytics.

Furthermore, I have additionally made available the bookdown I developed to have one summary/overview of the several topics including programming cheat sheets.  
I particularly enjoy working with R & R markdown though I also have been gaining experience in programs such as: Python, SPSS, Excel and Jupiter Notebooks.

Thank you for taking the time to discover my projects.
